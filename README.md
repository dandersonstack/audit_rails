### AuditRails
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/audit_rails.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/audit_rails)

An action based auditor, which has internal as well as outgoing link tracking.

It is inspired from many great audit gems in rails community that audits model and I was looking for a gem which can audit based on actions as well as can audit link tracking. This gem just serve this purpose.

Roughly it is doing similar to what Omniture does, but has very minimum features for now.

Now also has analytics(charts) for User counts

## User view count:
